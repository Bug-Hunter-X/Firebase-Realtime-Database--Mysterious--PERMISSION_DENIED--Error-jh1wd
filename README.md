This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive bug in Firebase Realtime Database where a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error is thrown despite what seems like properly configured security rules.  The issue often stems from subtle misconfigurations or unexpected data structures in the database.  This example shows a potential scenario and a solution focusing on careful rule definition and data structure validation.  See `firebaseBug.js` for the problematic code and `firebaseBugSolution.js` for the solution.
